Here's a template for a `README.md` file for a Selenium Python project with Pytest. You can customize it further based on your project's specifics.

# Selenium Python Project

This project automates browser actions using Selenium with Python. The tests are organized using Pytest, a framework that makes it easy to write simple as well as scalable test cases.

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your system:
- Python 3.12
- Pip (Python package installer)
- A browser Chrome

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    > **Note:** Ensure the WebDriver is added to your system's PATH, or specify its location in your test setup.

## Running the Tests

### Using Pytest

To run all the tests, simply execute:
```bash
python -m pytest
```

### Generating Test Reports

To generate a test report in HTML format:
```bash
pytest --html=report.html
```

### Running Tests in Headless Mode

To run the tests in headless mode (without opening the browser window), use:
```bash
pytest --headless
```

## Writing Tests

Tests are written using Pytest and Selenium WebDriver. You can create new test cases by adding them to the `tests/` directory.
